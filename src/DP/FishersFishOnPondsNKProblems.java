Problem 3 - Programming (Total 3)
DescriptionNotes
There are N number of fish ponds(A pool where farmers grow fishes), each pond contains ponds[N] number of fish. K fishermen are assigned to fish all these ponds together.

For each fish pond, it can only be assigned by 1 and only 1 fisher, and each fisherman can only fish contiguous ponds.

Each fisherman can fish at the same speed, say 1 fish per minute.

How can we find an assignment such that the total time for fishing all the fishes in all the fish ponds is minimized.  Return the minimum minutes.



Example:

pond = [7,2,5,10,8], K = 2

the maximum assignment will be assign pond[0],pond[1] and pond[2] to fisherman 1 and it would take

7 + 2 + 5 = 14 minutes and assigning the remaining two ponds pond[3] and pond[4] to fisherman 2 cost 10 + 8 = 18 minutes. Therefore the minimum time to finish all the ponds is 18 minutes
